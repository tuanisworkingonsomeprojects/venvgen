# Project Description
- Everytime we want to create a project in python we need to create a virtual environment, and the command line interface (CLI) might be complicated and can cause confusion, sometimes it might cause frustration and time consuming when you have to navigate to a long folder path or mistype something and then you have to retype everything again.
- VENVGEN will allow you to create your own <i>venv environment</i> without the necessity to remember the CLI commands.
- On top of that, you can edit the environment - install or uninstall the libraries.
- The program also checks for the validity of the libraries that you try to install. It also checks if you mis-deleted your venv by accident and helps you to recover the venv with according pre-installed libraries.

# How to install the software
```python
pip install venvgen
```

# How to use the software
- After Installation into your python environment, you can use the software easily in the terminal with friendly UI by just type
```python
venvgen
```
in the terminal and the program will start running.
